# ue4-gas-barebones
A barebones implementation of the Unreal Engine 4 Gameplay Ability System, intended to serve as a template to skip some of the boilerplate necessary to initialise a GAS project.

It implements a basic implementation of an Ability System Component (ASC) attached to the Player State, and a basic ability that will print a console message to confirm that the ASC is receiving input.
